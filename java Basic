What are the new features introduced in JAVA 8?
There are dozens of features added to Java 8, the most significant ones are mentioned below −

Lambda expression − Adds functional processing capability to Java.

Method references − Referencing functions by their names instead of invoking them directly. Using functions as parameter.

Default method − Interface to have default method implementation.

New tools − New compiler tools and utilities are added like 'jdeps' to figure out dependencies.

Stream API − New stream API to facilitate pipeline processing.

Date Time API − Improved date time API.

Optional − Emphasis on best practices to handle null values properly.

Nashorn, JavaScript Engine − A Java-based engine to execute JavaScript code.

Along with these new featuers, lots of feature enhancements are done under-the-hood, at both compiler and JVM level.

How will you sort a list of string using Java 8 lambda expression?
Following code sorts a list of string using Java 8 lambda expression:

//sort using java 8
private void sortUsingJava8(List<String> names) {
  Collections.sort(names, (s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2));
}
What are the characteristics of a Java 8 lambda expression?
A lambda expression is characterized by the following syntax -

parameter −> expression body
Following are the important characteristics of a lambda expression −

Optional type declaration − No need to declare the type of a parameter. The compiler can inference the same from the value of the parameter.

Optional parenthesis around parameter − No need to declare a single parameter in parenthesis. For multiple parameters, parentheses are required.

Optional curly braces − No need to use curly braces in expression body if the body contains a single statement.
